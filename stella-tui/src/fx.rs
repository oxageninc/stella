//! Reusable [`tachyonfx`] animation building blocks for the deck.
//!
//! Every surface that wants motion — a panel's content settling into place,
//! a tab switch, a view being torn down — should reach for a constructor
//! here instead of hand-rolling a `tachyonfx::fx::*` call inline, so the
//! deck's motion language (timing, curves, which colors carry brand meaning)
//! stays consistent in one place. Colors always come from [`crate::theme`].
//!
//! [`crate::splash`] doesn't build its effects here — it needs to scrub to
//! an arbitrary point on an external `f32` timeline (so a skip lands exactly
//! where it should), which these forward-only, real-time constructors don't
//! support — but it shares the same [`apply`] plumbing to drive whatever
//! effect it builds.
